## Install

Install the latest published binary.

macOS / Linux / Android / Termux:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RivoLink/leaf/main/scripts/install.sh | sh
```

Windows:

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RivoLink/leaf/main/scripts/install.ps1 | iex
```

npm:

```bash
npm install -g @rivolink/leaf
```

ArchLinux (AUR):

Use an [AUR helper](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/AUR_helpers), such as `yay`:

```bash
yay -S leaf-markdown-viewer
```

Verify the installation:

```bash
leaf --version
```

## Update

Update an existing installation to the latest published release.

Self:

```bash
leaf --update
```

`leaf --update` downloads the matching published asset, verifies it against the published `checksums.txt` SHA256, and then installs it.

On Windows, if replacing the running `.exe` is blocked by the OS, rerun the PowerShell installer from the install section.

npm:

```bash
npm update -g @rivolink/leaf
```

## Build

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RivoLink/leaf.git
cd leaf
```

Build the release binary locally:

```bash
cargo build --release
```

Create a local bin directory if needed and symlink `leaf` into it:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.local/bin
ln -sf "$(pwd)/target/release/leaf" ~/.local/bin/leaf
```

If `~/.local/bin` is not already on your `PATH`, add it to `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`:

```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
```

## Usage

```bash
# Open a Markdown file
leaf TESTING.md

# Watch mode — reloads automatically on save
leaf --watch TESTING.md
leaf -w TESTING.md

# Open the fuzzy Markdown picker
leaf

# Open the classic directory browser picker
leaf --picker

# Open the fuzzy Markdown picker, then watch the selected file
leaf -w

# Open the classic directory browser picker, then watch the selected file
leaf -w --picker

# Open a dash-prefixed filename
leaf -- -notes.md

# Stream Markdown from another CLI tool
claude "explain Rust lifetimes" | leaf

# Preview a local file through stdin
cat TESTING.md | leaf

```

## Configuration

Set default values for theme, editor, and watch mode via `config.toml`:

```bash
leaf --config
```

This opens the configuration file in your editor. If the file does not exist yet, leaf creates it with documented defaults.

```toml
theme = "ocean"      # arctic, forest, ocean, solarized-dark, or a custom theme file
editor = "nano"      # any editor in PATH
watch = false        # auto-reload when opening a file
```

All settings are optional. CLI arguments always take priority. See [`config.toml`](config.toml) for details.

## Custom Themes

Create a `.toml` file that inherits from a built-in theme and overrides specific colors:

```toml
theme = "/path/to/custom-theme.toml"
```

Relative paths are resolved from the config file directory.

```toml
# custom-theme.toml
base = "ocean"
syntax = "base16-ocean.dark"

[ui]
content_bg = "#282828"
toc_accent = "#fe8019"

[markdown]
text = "#ebdbb2"
heading_1 = "#fabd2f"
```

See [`gruvbox.toml`](gruvbox.toml) for a complete example with all available color keys.

## Troubleshooting

### Windows: missing Visual C++ runtime

If `leaf.exe` does not start on Windows and reports a missing MSVC runtime, install the latest supported Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable from Microsoft Learn:

- https://learn.microsoft.com/fr-fr/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-170

Direct download for the latest supported **X64** Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable:

- https://aka.ms/vc14/vc_redist.x64.exe

For `leaf-windows-x86_64.exe`, the relevant package is the latest supported **X64** Visual C++ v14 Redistributable.

### Windows: update or file replacement error

If `leaf --update` fails on Windows with an error about replacing, renaming, or writing `leaf.exe`, the running executable was likely locked by the OS.

Close any terminal session still running `leaf`, then rerun the PowerShell installer from the install section:

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RivoLink/leaf/main/scripts/install.ps1 | iex
```

## Uninstall

macOS / Linux / Android / Termux:

```bash
rm -f ~/.local/bin/leaf
```

Windows:

```powershell
Remove-Item "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\Programs\leaf\leaf.exe" -Force
```

npm:

```bash
npm uninstall -g @rivolink/leaf
```
